<h1>Strawberry Perl Support </h1>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
  <tr>
    <td><h2>A quick word before we continue... </h2>
      <p>Strawberry Perl is a community-driven Open Source project, which means that most of the people directly involved have jobs, families and/or other commitments beyond just Strawberry. </p>
      <p>To maintain sustainable long-term production of the distribution, we like to keep everything as simple and community driven as possible, so that our smartest users can help each other and all official features &quot;Just Work&quot;. </p>
      <p>Then four times a year, with the changing of the seasons, we take the best ideas and release-ready improvements from the community and incorporate them back into the main distribution.</p>
      <p>So a gentle reminder, you are amoung friends here. And we'll do whatever we can to help. But please be civil and understand some problems just aren't solved yet, or haven't been incorporated into Strawberry because current solutions just aren't robust or sustainable enough yet, which is our first priority.</p>
      <p>And of course, more helpers are always welcome :) </p>
      <h2>More Information</h2>
      <p><a href="http://win32.perl.org/">win32.perl.org</a> - The home of the Win32 Perl community </p>
      <p><a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/perl5/index.cgi">Perl 5 Wiki</a> - The new and growing knowledge base for Perl 5</p>
      <p><a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Perl::Dist">Perl::Dist</a> - The toolkit we created to build Perl for Windows</p>
      <p><a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Perl::Dist::Strawberry">Perl::Dist::Strawberry</a> - The Perl::Dist subclass that defines and builds Strawberry Perl.</p>
      <h2>You've got Questions? </h2>
      <p><a href="irc://irc.perl.org/win32">#win32 on irc.perl.org</a> - The best answers, but you might need to wait until someone is awake.</p>
      <p><a href="http://perlmonks.org/">Perl Monks</a> - Often better quality answers than IRC for questions that aren't Strawberry specific. </p>
      <p><a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/win32-vanilla@perl.org/info.html">Mailing List</a> - Great for suggesting new features, and offering to help write them, and dev stuff, etc.</p>
      <h2>Bug Reports</h2>
      <p>If your bug is with a specific module not working with Strawberry (for example, you tried to install it with the CPAN client, but it failed) please report the bug to the specific Request Tracker queue.</p>
      <p>You can find the link on the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/">http://search.cpan.org/</a> page for that module.  </p>
      <p>If you have a problem with the packaging of Strawberry, or anything broken out the box, please file a bug report (with as much details as possible) on the RT page linked from the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Perl::Dist::Strawberry">Perl::Dist::Strawberry</a> page.</p>
      <h2>Throwing Money at Your Problem</h2>
      <p>In situations where you simply <strong>MUST</strong> have commercial support for operations or policy reasons (you know who you are) Strawberry may not be your best option. While their ActivePerl distribution may not have CPAN support out the box, <a href="http://activestate.com/">ActiveState</a> does offers support on commercial terms and can be modified to do most things that Strawberry can, albeit with some effort.</p>
      <p>This may change in future, but remains true for the present.  </p>
