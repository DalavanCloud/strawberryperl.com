    <td><h2>A quick word before we continue... </h2>
      <p>Strawberry Perl is a community-driven Open Source project, which means that most of the people directly involved have jobs, families and/or other commitments beyond just Strawberry. </p>
      <p>To maintain sustainable long-term production of the distribution, we like to keep everything as simple and community driven as possible, so that our smartest users can help each other and all official features &quot;Just Work&quot;. </p>
      <p>So a gentle reminder, you are amoung friends here. And we'll do whatever we can to help. But please be civil and understand some problems just aren't solved yet, or haven't been incorporated into Strawberry because current solutions just aren't robust or sustainable enough yet, which is our first priority.</p>
      <p>And of course, more helpers are always welcome :)</p>
      <h2>More Information</h2>
      <p><a href="http://learn.perl.org/">learn.perl.org</a> - Good starting point for Perl newbies</p>
      <p><a href="http://win32.perl.org/">win32.perl.org</a> - The home of the Win32 Perl community</p>
      <h2>You've got Questions? </h2>
      <p><a href="irc://irc.perl.org/win32">#win32 on irc.perl.org</a> - The best answers, but you might need to wait until someone is awake.</p>
      <p><a href="http://perlmonks.org/">Perl Monks</a> or <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> - Often better quality answers than IRC for questions that aren't Strawberry specific.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/win32-vanilla@perl.org/info.html">Mailing List</a> - Great for suggesting new features, and offering to help write them, and dev stuff, etc.</p>
      <h2>Bug Reports</h2>
      <p>If you have a problem with the packaging of Strawberry, or anything broken out the box, please file a bug report (with as much details as possible) on our <a href="https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=Perl-Dist-Strawberry">Request Tracker</a> where you can also find the already reported issues.
      <p>If your bug is with a specific module not working with Strawberry (for example, you tried to install it with the CPAN client, but it failed) please report the bug to the specific Request Tracker queue. You can find the link on the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/">http://search.cpan.org/</a> page for that module.
      <h2>Throwing Money at Your Problem</h2>
      <p>In situations where you simply MUST have commercial support for operations or policy reasons (you know who you are) Strawberry may not be your best option.</p>
      <p>If the fact that Strawberry isn't released by a company worries you, remember that 100,000+ people and companies trust our releases, including Larry Wall and most of the top CPAN authors.</p>
